Ingredients:

- 140g dried wholewheat noodles
- 1 tbsp groundnut oil
- 2 tbsp grated ginger
- 1 medium red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, chopped into small chunks
- 1 tbsp Shaohsing rice wine
- 700ml hot vegetable stock
- 4 chestnut mushrooms, sliced
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp cornflour mixed with 2 tbsp cold water to make a paste
- 1 handful beansprouts
- 2 spring onions, sliced

Directions:

1. Bring a small pan of water to the boil and cook the noodles 
following pack instructions. Drain, rinse under cold running water 
to stop them cooking further, then drizzle over a little oil to 
prevent them sticking together. Divide between 2 deep bowls.

2. Heat a wok over high heat and add the rest of the oil. When it 
starts to smoke, add the ginger and chilli, then stir-fry for a 
few secs. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 2 mins. As the meat 
starts to turn brown, add the rice wine and cook for 3 mins more. 
Add the vegetable stock, bring to a simmer, then add the mushrooms 
Season with the dark soy, light soy and rice vinegar.

3. Bring back to a simmer, then add the cornflour paste. Simmer 
and stir until thickened. Stir in the beansprouts and most of the 
spring onions, then ladle the soup over the noodles. Serve 
immediately, scattered with the remaining spring onions.
